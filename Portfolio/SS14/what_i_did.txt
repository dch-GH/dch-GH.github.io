SS14 (Space Station 14) is a ground-up open source remake of the cult-classic Space Station 13. 
My largest contributions were the PDA, Microwave, Reagent Grinder and Round End Summary Screen in SS14.
I also contributed various smaller fixes, features and tweaks over the span of 2019-2021. Unfortunately, I contributed across multiple Github accounts and email addresses, so the history is not contigual and accounted for accurately. This was a mistake on my part.
